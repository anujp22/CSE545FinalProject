Mixed Data for Bin Packing Problem
----------------------------------
This dataset contains a mix of item sizes, ranging from 1 to 100 units.
The objective is to pack these items efficiently into bins with a fixed capacity.

File Contents:
- Bin Capacity: 150
- 100 item sizes, varying from small (1) to large (100) units.

This dataset represents a challenging scenario with diverse item sizes, which tests the algorithm's ability to handle varied items effectively.
