Clustered Data for Bin Packing Problem
--------------------------------------
This dataset contains items clustered in specific size ranges: either small (1 to 30 units) or large (70 to 100 units).
The objective is to pack these items efficiently into bins with a fixed capacity.

File Contents:
- Bin Capacity: 150
- 100 item sizes, grouped in clusters around small and large sizes.

This dataset mimics real-world inventory management where items often fall into particular size categories, challenging the algorithm to optimize clustered item packing.
