The objective of this project is to address the Bin Packing Problem (BPP) by developing a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) integrated with Wisdom of Crowds (WoC) to minimize the number of bins required for storing items of various sizes under fixed bin capacity constraints. This hybrid approach is designed for applications in logistics, such as truck loading, container shipping, and warehouse storage, where optimizing space utilization is crucial for reducing operational costs and enhancing efficiency. By integrating WoC with GA, the algorithm leverages collective intelligence, identifying high-quality packing patterns and using them to iteratively improve item placement, thus achieving a solution that minimizes bin usage while maintaining efficient space allocation.

This project assesses the hybrid GA-WoC model's performance by comparing it to a conventional GA in terms of solution quality and runtime. Analysis focuses on how the hybrid modelâ€™s adaptive learning of efficient configurations helps in resolving complex packing tasks faster and more accurately. Results will demonstrate the potential of this hybrid approach to transform space optimization processes, showing its applicability in real-world inventory management, freight optimization, and beyond.
