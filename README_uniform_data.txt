Uniform Data for Bin Packing Problem
------------------------------------
This dataset contains item sizes that are relatively uniform, ranging between 40 and 60 units.
The objective is to pack these items efficiently into bins with a fixed capacity.

File Contents:
- Bin Capacity: 150
- 100 item sizes, each between 40 and 60 units.

This dataset simulates scenarios where item sizes are nearly identical, requiring efficient use of space without much size variation.
